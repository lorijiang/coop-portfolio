                <p>While this was the map's main feature, we also retained positive aspects from the original map like the historical information, and resolved major usability issues to help user engagement.

Then, we looked into our personal lives for inspiration found that our team members all had experience living with our Chinese grandparents who were immigrants, which drove us to want to design an app to benefit them in some way.</p>

                        Using our user personas to guide our design thinking, we thought that there would need to be:
                    <li> language translation feature to overcome language barriers near beginning of user flow </li> 
                    <li> simple events page as the home page</li>

                    <p>  Due to time and resources constraints, our user research was limited to a small sample size and relied a lot on secondary research. If I were to continue this project, I would like to gain a deeper understanding of our target audience through more user-interviews.  </p>
