                    <p> We conducted online research to determine what kind of pain points are prevelant for older users and mobile apps. From this, we realized that older adults were at higher risk for loneliness, and immigrant populations were at even higher risk. </p>

                    <p> Our whole team identified as Chinese, so we spoke to our grandparents to develop a quick understanding of our user group. Ideally, I would have liked to conduct more thorough research but we faced time constraints at this stage of the project. Through our quick anecdotal research, we created a user persona to help clarify our target user group's goals. </p>

                <p> Next we made mid-fidelity wireframes. When iterating, I took into account the accessibility needs of the older adult group by enlarging fonts, designing with tap over swipe gestures, and high contrast colors, as these seemed to be common standards based on research. </p>

                <p> We conducted usability testing to validate whether our mockup pages were addressing older Chinese immigrants' needs. We showed our mockup pages to 6 participants and collected data using two methods: think aloud and user interviews. </p>

            <div class="flexbox challenges-container section">
                <h2> Challenges / Lessons Learned </h2>
                <p> One of the main challenges of this project was that our scope was initially too large as we had chosen to design for mutliple older immigrant adult communities. However, upon receiving feedback we narrowed our target user group to older Chinese immigrant adults so that the language feature in the app would be easier to implement and we could have a more specific idea of how to design the interface for this group.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Looking back on the project, this might not have been the most viable design solution as I now realize designing the interface in another language has a huge impact on the subsequent UX/UI decisions. Since Chinese characters are symbolic and not linear like English characters, this would change the text spacing a lot. Furthermore, we would have to take into consideration appropriate translation to convey the same meaning in another language. Therefore, this was a good opportunity to learn and make mistakes, and next time I would do more extensive research before pursuing a design direciton. </p>
