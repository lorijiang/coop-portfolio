                    <h2> Problem: </h2>
                    <p class="problem-text"> Slack is used by many tech industry professionals to collaborate with their coworkers, however the collaborations between multiple teams can be tedious when having to manually add a long list of team members. </p>
                    <h2> Solution: </h2>
                    <p class="solution-text"> Creating a merge feature with the ability to merge multiple slack channels in one click. </p>

                    <p> <strong>Prompt:</strong> Redesign or add a feature to an existing mobile application to better address user needs. </p>
                    <p> <strong>Time:</strong> 4 weeks </p>
                    <p> <strong>Tools used:</strong> Figma</p>

                    <p> <strong>Team:</strong> Myself</p>
                    <p> <strong>My Role:</strong> UX/UI Design </p>

            <div class="flexbox section">
                <h2> User Research </h2>
                <p> After choosing the Slack application, I conducted user research through interviews and personal use of the app to identify design problems. </p>
                <p> User Interviews / competitive analysis  </p>
                <p> The main pain point identified was the tedious nature of merging channels when collaborating with different teams. </p>

            <div class="flexbox section">
                <h2> Storyboard </h2>
                <p> I created a storyboard to contextualize how developers and designers can benefit from this channel merging feature. </p>

            <div class="flexbox section">
                <h2> Task Flow</h2>
                <p> I created a task flow diagram to help visualize the user experience. </p>

                <h2> Low Fidelity Wireframes </h2>
                <p> Next, I sketched low fidelity wireframes to visualize the merge feature. </p>

                <h2> High Fidelity Wireframes </h2>
                <p> After receiving feedback, I improved the design and created a high-fidelity mockup in Figma. </p>

            <div class="flexbox section">
                <h2> Challenges </h2>
                <p> I found that the main challenge of this project was finding problems within an existing app and creating changes within the constraints of the application's existing style. It was restrictive to only be able to design the mockups using only the company's existing user interface rules but served as a good learning opportunity for future work within a company. </p>
